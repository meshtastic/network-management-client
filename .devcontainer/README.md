## :whale: Using the Devcontainer

This project includes a [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) configuration for Visual Studio Code, which allows you to develop inside a containerized environment. This ensures that all developers have a consistent development environment, regardless of their local machine setup.

> **Note:** The devcontainer is tested on:\
Windows 11 with Docker Desktop and WSL2 Ubuntu.\
Ubuntu, use command `xhost +` let the display through.\
Fedora/Nobara 41.

### Prerequisites

To use the devcontainer, you need to have the following installed:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for Visual Studio Code.

### Setup

1. Open up a new blank workspace in Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to the Remote Explorer extension.
3. Clone this repository in container volume. (Dev Volumes)
4. Launch the Dev Container.

By using the devcontainer, you ensure that your development environment is consistent with the rest of the team, reducing the likelihood of environment-specific issues.

## Application

Once the devcontainer is set up, you can use the same development commands as described in the [Development Commands](/README.md#development-commands) section. The devcontainer includes all necessary dependencies and tools for developing and testing the project.

Start the application by running command `pnpm run rust:dev`.

> **Note:** If you encounter any issues you can always refresh the devcontainer by rebuilding it. `F1` > `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container`.

## Meshtasticd and CLI

The container has [meshtasticd](https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/linux-native-hardware/) installed and can be started by running `meshtasticd -c .devcontainer/config.yaml` in the terminal. \
This allows connecting to a meshtastic device on `localhost:4403`.

The container also has [meshtastic CLI](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/python/cli/) installed, once `meshtasticd` is running you can configure it using `meshtastic --host localhost COMMANDS`.

```
meshtastic --host localhost --set-owner Devcontainer --set-owner-short VSCD
meshtastic --host localhost --setlat 51.5007324 --setlon -0.1294963
```

> **Note:** If you encounter any issues connection to `localhost:4403` you might need to run the `meshtasticd -c .devcontainer/config.yaml` command again.
